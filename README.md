# E-Commerce Sales - Excel Dashboard and Pivot Tables

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing e-commerce sales data from different channels covering a variety of products.The Goal is to Analyze the general sales trends by examining info such as month, category, currency, and customer for each sale. This will give an idea about how the e-commerce business is performing in each channel.

## Data Cleaning

Prior to analysis, the raw data is subjected to a data cleaning process to ensure accuracy and reliability. This included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and handling Date-time format.

## Excel Dashboard

An Excel dashboard was created to present key findings and visualizations from the data analysis. The dashboard includes interactive charts, tables, and pivot tables to provide an intuitive and comprehensive view of the data.

## Pivot Tables

Pivot tables were utilized to aggregate and summarize the data, enabling easy exploration and identification of trends. The pivot tables allow for dynamic grouping, filtering, and calculation of metrics, providing valuable insights.

## Findings

* The total revenue for Q2 2022 decreased by -18.77% from April to June, with May revenue experiencing a -9.06% decrease from April, and June revenue seeing a -10.68% decrease from May, which is a cause of concern.
* The revenue is dominated by the product category "Set," which accounts for 49.88% of total revenue, followed by kurta with 27.09% and Western Dress with 14.28%.
* The top 5 product categories by average price are Set (780), Kurta (427), Western Dress (724), Ethnic Dress (682), and Top (503), indicating that these products are high-value orders.
* The total number of cancelled and returned orders was 20,428, which represents 15.86% of all orders. Of these, 14.22% were cancelled and 1.64% were returned.
* Around 99% of orders are placed by Regular customers and the remaining by the Business customers.
  
## Recommendations

* Promotion to drive interest in the Western Dress category
* To capture consumer attention, strategies such as bundling purchases or offering a complimentary item from lower-selling categories with relatively lower-priced products (e.g., bottoms, blouses, dupattas) could be employed.
* Sellers should prioritize efficient delivery methods to ensure customer satisfaction. Understanding fulfillment processes and anticipating potential risks associated with different shipping methods are vital steps to providing a seamless shopping experience. This approach not only bolsters customer trust but also fosters lasting relationships.
